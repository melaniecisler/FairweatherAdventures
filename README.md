Name: Fairweather Adventures

Description: The Fairweather Adventures app solves the real world problem for short notice travelers who are looking for  National Park information and also want to know the current weather and 5-day forecast for their chosen park adventure. The app integrates data received from multiple server-side API requests (Open Weather Map API https://openweathermap.org/ and , National Park Services API https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/guides.htm ) to solve this problem. The  motivation to build this project was to help clients achieve their travel goals by having an accessible website that is easy to navigate.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS (Bulma), JavaScript, server-side API's. 

Challenges:  Separating some of the images, getting the API calls to write to the screen even after we console logged correctly. Issues with our footer running through the bottom images. Issues with merging API requests with so much information so we stuck to a smaller list of parks broken down by region/state then by zip code to overlap with calling the zip code in the weather API.  


Future development: Make a clickable US state map , show national parks in that state, check out open weather map in more detail to what other features we can use. Add in a map/directions link with the output for each park.
